Bash dice, nuff said

# How to use:
There are two ways to make it work:<br />
	1. Pass two arguments when calling a script: first is number of dice to be thrown, second is a string of maximum throw values.<br />
	2. Pass one argument when calling a script: it must be a number of dice.<br />
	3. Just call a function, it will read all needed arguments.<br />
