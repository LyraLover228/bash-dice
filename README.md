Bash dice, nuff said

# How to use:
There are two ways to make it work:
	1) Pass two arguments when calling a script: first is number of dice to be thrown, second is a string of maximum throw values.
	2) Pass one argument when calling a script: it must be a number of dice.
	3) Just call a function, it will read all needed arguments.
